Install nix and various via nix-env packages https://nixos.org/download/.    
Make sure to only install non redundant binaries with nix and no services as they should be managed by t  he host itself.
    
Installed docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-repository.    
    
This is needed to run nix and other commands in tmux    
unset __ETC_PROFILE_NIX_SOURCED    
    
Install a firewall ufw and block anything by default.    
Expose ports only with ufw.

The data folder is manually filled with the certificates for tls.

Did some testing with docker containers like deleting them and starting them new.
